# Programming Basics
The "Programming Basics" course gives the initial programming skills necessary for all technology majors at the Software University. This includes writing basic coding skills, working with a development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input data and printing results), using conditional statements (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while).

# Programming Fundamentals
With the Programming Fundamentals course, students begin to study SoftUni's internal program for the comprehensive training of software engineers. The course examines fundamental concepts in programming that are the basis for effective and quality training in professional modules. Learners build on the knowledge gained in the Programming Basics course and begin to use more complex techniques and structures than programming, such as: arrays, sheets, objects and classes.

Additional technologies needed by each software developer are studied, such as HTML and CSS, HTTP, bit operations and more. The basics of web development are discussed, as well as some of the most common technologies and tools, with which the course successfully builds an idea in the students about the upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will acquire from them to become successful software developers.

# JS Advanced
In the JS Advanced course, students will gain in-depth knowledge of the JavaScript language, such as syntax basics, array work, matrices, objects, classes and feature writing. They will study more complex concepts such as function context, explicit binding, event loop. The course will develop their algorithmic thinking. Upon successful completion of this course, they will have the opportunity to work with the DOM tree, to manipulate it and to work with "events". The functional and OOP approach to programming with JavaScript will be considered, studying concepts such as inheritance, object composition and prototype chain.

# JS Applications
In the "JS Applications" course, students will learn what HTTP requests are and how to use them. They will learn about REST Services, what a Baas is (backend as a service) and how to work with it, what asynchronous code means (Promises, using async/await), what Templating and Routing are. During the course they will create a Single Page Application, using the techniques learned from previous lectures, which will be evaluated. They will understand what the architecture of an application is and how to properly structure their applications. Towards the end of the course, they will look at different design templates and their practical direction, create their own Web Parts using the Web Components standard, and elevate a Wepback environment from scratch.

# JS Back-End
The course is intensive and aims to introduce learners to the development of server JavaScript applications on the Node platform. js using Express. js as a framework. During the training, students will learn how to create a server with Node. js, learn the server-client architecture and how to make easy and fast data-driven web applications with Node. js, Express. js and MongoDB using modern techniques and tools. One of the most popular non-relational databases, MongoDB, will be considered, along with the Mongoose library for picking up data from it. Towards the end of the course, a complete REST API will be built from scratch using Express. js and MongoDB. There is a lot of emphasis on practical exercises that will involve students in real projects for web page development, implementation of site fragments and creation of complete modern websites with good vision, modern structure and mobile support.

# Angular 
The Angular course provides the knowledge and practical skills to build Single Page Applications with Angular technology, Google's work frame and one of the most popular at the moment. You'll learn what TypeScript is, basic syntax and concepts, and what more it offers over JavaScript, as development facilities in the browser and on mobile platforms. They study what is Single Page Application (SPA), architectural templates for SPA applications, components, directives and their implementation in Angular. Views and templates for data visualization, models, components, data binding, multiview, observables, routing, data mining and dependency injection (DI) are studied.

# HTML & CSS
The aim of the course "HTML & CSS" is to lay basic knowledge in web technologies and in particular familiarization with HTML5 and CSS3. Initial knowledge in web development, web browsers, HTML/CSS/DOM development tools is acquired, and practical skills in using the Web Content Description Language (HTML) and the Web Content Styling Language (CSS) are developed. The basic HTML tags, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, controls and tags for semantic HTML are studied. Emphasis is placed on basic CSS selectors and styles, class work, presentation rules, positioning and layout rules in CSS. The latest developments in the HTML5 and CSS3 standard are covered. The course emphasizes practical exercises with HTML and CSS, through which it will involve students in real projects for web page development, implementation of site fragments and creation of complete modern websites with good vision, modern structure and mobile support.

# React
The course provides the knowledge and practical skills to build Single Page Applications using one of the most popular work frameworks. Architectural templates for SPA applications, components and others are studied. Views and templates for data visualization, models, data binding, multi-view operation, routing, data mining are studied.

The training provides knowledge and practical skills for the development of Single Page Applications (SPA), using ReactJS technology - one of the most popular and fastest libraries for displaying client interfaces developed and maintained by Facebook and Instagram. Special attention will be paid to the syntax JSX, working with queries and Promises, splitting one application into components, routing and validating shapes and different ways to style components, using techniques such as CSS Modules and Styled Components. New concepts in the library will also be considered, such as React Hooks and Context API. The training will also focus on writing Unit Tests using JEST.
